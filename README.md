### Introduction

This project focuses on Retail Sales Forecasting using advanced machine learning techniques. It emphasizes data preprocessing, feature enhancement, and careful algorithm selection to ensure accurate predictions. The Streamlit application integrates Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify trends and patterns within the data. Users can interactively explore top-performing stores and departments, conduct meaningful feature comparisons, and generate personalized sales forecasts. The project is designed to deliver actionable insights, improving decision-making in the retail sector. The combination of machine learning and interactive tools enhances the analysis process, making it more dynamic and user-friendly.

### Key Technologies and Installation

The project is built using a range of key technologies, including Python, Scikit-Learn, PostgreSQL, Numpy, Pandas, Plotly, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Streamlit. To run the project, you need to install these packages using pip. The installation process involves cloning the repository, installing the required packages, and running the Streamlit app. The app can then be accessed through a web browser, allowing users to interact with the forecasting tools and visualizations.

### Data Preprocessing and Model Development

Data preprocessing is a crucial step in this project, involving the transformation of categorical features into numerical values, handling missing data, and creating new features to enhance model performance. The project tackles the challenge of over 50% null values in the 'MarkDown' columns by training two separate modelsâ€”one using the 'MarkDown' features and one without them. Various algorithms are evaluated based on R2 scores, with the Random Forest Regressor chosen for its balance between accuracy and interpretability. The final models achieve high accuracy, and the chosen model is saved for future use.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Prediction

The Streamlit application offers several EDA features, including tools to identify the top-performing stores and departments based on weekly sales. Users can compare the impact of various features on sales, explore trends, and generate predictions using a pre-trained Random Forest Regressor model. The app allows users to input specific parameters and receive personalized sales forecasts. This interactive approach makes it easy for users to explore different scenarios and understand the factors driving sales performance.

### Contribution and Further Development

Contributions to the project are encouraged, with the repository open for issues and pull requests. The project aims to continuously improve and adapt to new insights and techniques. By integrating user feedback and staying updated with the latest advancements in machine learning and data analysis, the project seeks to provide a robust tool for retail sales forecasting and decision-making.
